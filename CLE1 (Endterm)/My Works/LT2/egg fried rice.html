		<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Rice (as much as you fancy really!)</li>
			<li>Half an onion (Or more, again if you fancy it)</li>
			<li>A tin of sweetcorn</li>
			<li>A few mushrooms </li>
			<li>1-2 eggs</li>
			
		</ul>
		<p><b>Method</b></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Start cooking the rice however you do, and put some oil in a frying pan.</li>
			<li>Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesnâ€™t matter particularly and throw into the frying pan.</li>
			<li>Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions</li>
			<li>Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add it into the frying pan.</li>
			<li>Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up</li>
			<li>Break the eggs into the pan (OR beat them together in another bowl and tip into the frying pan) and stir the mixture up.</li>
			<li>At this point, you need to keep stirring the mixture, keeping the eggs moving. Keep going until the eggs have cooked, should take about 5-8 minutes maybe?</li>

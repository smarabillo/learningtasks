        <h1> Here Are Ways To Fight <span>Corruption</span> </h1>
        <ol>
            <li><b><span>Corruption is not only about bribes:</span></b> People especially the poor get hurt when 
            resources are wasted. Thats why it is so important to understand the different
            kinds of corruption to develop smart responses. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b><span>Power of the people:</span></b> Create pathways that give citizens relevant tools to engage and participate in their governments – identify priorities,  problems and find solutions.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b><span>Act globally and locally:</span></b> Keep citizens engaged on corruption at local, national, international and global levels – in line with the scale and scope of corruption. Make use of the architecture that has been developed and the platforms that exist for engagement.

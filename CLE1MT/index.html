            <h1>Corruption in the <span> Philippines</span></h1>
            <p>Corruption is a significant obstacle to good governance in the Philippines. A review of recent literature suggests that all 
            levels of corruption, from petty bribery to grand corruption, patronage and state capture, exist in the Philippines
            at a considerable scale and scope. Significant efforts have been made to combat corruption, which include putting in place
            legal and institutional frameworks, as well as efforts by civil society organisations and the media. 
            Donor agencies are also actively involved in building capacity to curb corruption in the Philippines. 
            The success of these initiatives, however, is far from guaranteed and many observers
            believe that structural obstacles such as entrenched cronyism continue to undermine anti-corruption efforts.</p>
